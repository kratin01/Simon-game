# Simon-game
this program simulates a Simon Says game where players must repeat a growing sequence of button colors and sounds. The game keeps track of the player's progress, displays the current level, and provides feedback for correct and incorrect inputs. Players need to remember and reproduce the sequence correctly to advance to higher levels.
